    The following chart suggesting tasks are based on the ECHARTS library.

    1. Analyse the data types within the schema
    2. Suggest 3 DIFFERENT main chart types 
    3. Suggest 1 sub chart types from each main category
    4. Based on the sub chart type, suggest the 3 columns (column 1, column 2 and column 3) that will be included in the plot.
    5. Select the aggregation for the chart
    6. Create a chart title
    7. Create a summarised description of what the chatrt shows

    REMEMBER THAT SOME SUB CHART TYPES HAVE ONLY 2 COLUMNS AND SOME HAVE 3.

    Column1 will be shown on the xaxis, Column2 on the yaxis and Column3 usually a category (if needed) will be used to create charts such as multi and stacked.
    
    The chart options are structured as
